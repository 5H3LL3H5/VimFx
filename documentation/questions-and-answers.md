# Questions & Answers

## Will VimFx provide advanced Find features?

One VimFx’s key feauters is to embrace standard Firefox features. As long as
Firefox’s Find Bar doesn’t support for example reverse search (vim’s `?`
command) or regex search, VimFx won’t either.

The [public API] could be used, though, to integrate with another Add-on that
provides advanced Find features.
