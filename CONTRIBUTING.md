Description

VimFx version: 
Firefox version: 
OS: 
Keyboard language: 
Worked before: 
Example URL(s):
- 
```

Example:

```md
Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to one of the online terminals on codeacademy.com.
2. Focus the online terminal.
3. Type something into it.

VimFx doesn’t recognize the online terminal as a text input, so instead of
typing into it I end up activating VimFx commands. A work-around is to use
Ignore mode.

VimFx version: 0.11.0
Firefox version: 43
OS: Ubuntu 15.04
Keyboard language: en-US
Worked before: No
Example URL(s):
