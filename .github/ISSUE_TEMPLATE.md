| EXAMPLE:
|
| Steps to reproduce:
|
| 1. Go to one of the online terminals on codeacademy.com.
| 2. Focus the online terminal.
| 3. Type something into it.
|
| VimFx doesn’t recognize the online terminal as a text input, so instead of
| typing into it I end up activating VimFx commands. A work-around is to use
| Ignore mode.
