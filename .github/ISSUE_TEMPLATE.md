| EXAMPLE:
|
| Steps to reproduce:
|
| 1. Go to one of the online terminals on codeacademy.com.
| 2. Focus the online terminal.
| 3. Type something into it.
|
| Expected reult: VimFx recognizes the terminal as a text input, automatically
| allowing to type into it.
|
| Actual result: Instead of typing into the terminal I end up activating VimFx
| commands.
|
| A work-around is to use Ignore mode.
